Fandom analysis scripts.

This repository collects scripts, notebooks, and other records documenting 
the steps taken to process and analyze film scripts and fan works based
on them.

* "script-fan-comparison.ipynb": This performs approximate nearest neighbor
matching to find phrases in fan works that have been borrowed from the
original script.
* "clean-html.ipynb": This strips html tags from fan works.
* "word-counts.ipynb": This counts words, lemmas, and part-of-speech tags
for each fan work.
